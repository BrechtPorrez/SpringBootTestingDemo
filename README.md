# SpringBootTestingDemo

This project is still in a very early stage. The goal is to implement different Spring Boot features,
test them out and play around with them. All the features that are implemented should be unit tested.
The goal is not to implement Spring Cloud, I will create another repo for that later

## Implemented features
- Integration test
- Unit test
- Unit test of REST controller
- Unit test of repository
- Application events
- Swagger and Swagger UI
- Postgres
- Docker compose for Postgres and Redis


## To be implemented
- Automatic mapper so the Domain object and the DTO can be split up
- RabbitMQ
- Kafka
- OAuth2
- E-mails
- Environment variables
- Websockets
- Server send event
- Flyway
- Batch processing
- Rest template
- ...
